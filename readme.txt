This is a cpp app I wrote in highschool while learning to program.
It might be helpful for anyone interested in seeing what rudimentary C++ code looks like.

It takes an integer (like 123456789) and returns a string (like "One Hundred and Twenty Three Million, Four Hundred and Fifty Six Thousand, Seven Hundred and Eighty Nine").
